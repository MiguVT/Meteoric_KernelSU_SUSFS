## 🔧 About This Project

This project is a **specialized fork** of [WildKernels/GKI_KernelSU_SUSFS](https://github.com/WildKernels/GKI_KernelSU_SUSFS), completely adapted and optimized to build the **Meteoric Kernel** with KernelSU and SUSFS integration.

Unlike the original project that builds generic GKI kernels for multiple Android versions, this fork is **exclusively designed** for the **Meteoric Kernel** - a high-performance custom kernel specifically tailored for Nothing Phone devices.

### 🎯 Key Differences from Original GKI Project:

- **🌟 Meteoric-Specific**: Builds only Meteoric Kernel instead of generic GKI
- **📱 Device-Targeted**: Optimized exclusively for Nothing Phone (sm8475 chipset)
- **🎯 Android 12 Focus**: Specialized for Android 12 (5.10 kernel version) only
- **🔧 Custom Source**: Uses [kernel_nothing_sm8475_github_actions](https://github.com/MiguVT/kernel_nothing_sm8475_github_actions) (clean branch)
- **⚡ Performance Enhanced**: Includes Meteoric's specific optimizations and features

**Meteoric Kernel** delivers exceptional performance and stability for Nothing Phone devices, providing advanced features while maintaining compatibility with the latest KernelSU and SUSFS technologies.

## 🎯 Supported Devices & Compatibility

### ✅ Supported Devices:

- **Nothing Phone (2)** - sm8475 (Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1) chipset
- **Android 12 based ROMs** (AOSP/LineageOS/Nothing OS)
- **Kernel version**: 5.10 (specifically optimized)

### ⚠️ Important Compatibility Notes:

- **This kernel is NOT compatible with other Android versions** (A13+) - That means no Android 13 kernel, but you can use it on higher Android versions.
- **This kernel is NOT compatible with other devices** (non-sm8475)
- **This kernel is specifically built for Nothing Phone architecture**

### 🔍 Before Installation:

- Verify your device is Nothing Phone (2) with sm8475 chipset
- Ensure you're running Android 12 based ROM
- Check your current kernel version compatibility

## 🆚 Meteoric vs Generic GKI Kernels

### 🌟 **Meteoric Kernel Advantages:**

- **Device-Specific Optimizations**: Tailored for Nothing Phone hardware
- **Enhanced Performance**: Custom tweaks for sm8475 chipset
- **Nothing-Specific Features**: Hardware-specific optimizations
- **Stable & Tested**: Thoroughly tested on Nothing devices

### ⚖️ **Why Not Generic GKI:**

- **Generic Nature**: GKI kernels are one-size-fits-all
- **Limited Optimization**: No device-specific enhancements
- **Compatibility Issues**: May not fully utilize Nothing Phone features
- **Performance Gap**: Less optimized for sm8475 architecture

### 💡 **Best Choice for Nothing Phone Users:**

If you own a Nothing Phone (2), the **Meteoric Kernel** is specifically designed for your device and will provide better performance, stability, and feature compatibility compared to generic GKI kernels.
